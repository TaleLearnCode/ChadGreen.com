But, with the pandemic a lot has changed. For us, it means we meet virtually and now twice a month. Going to virtual meetings has opened the doors for many more opportunities. We now have speakers from around the world. And, more members also from around the world. \r\n\r\nWe have topics such as C#, .NET, .NET Core, Web, ASP.NET, MVC, Design Patterns, Software Development techniques, SOLID principles, Entity Framework, Visual Studio, VS Code, Debugging, TDD, testing frameworks like SpecFlow, Jasmine, and many more.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each meeting, the virtual meeting is started and anyone coming earlier can mingle. At 6:30 PM CST, there is a few minutes of introduction. This is when information is shared with the group about upcoming events, etc. At about 6:40 we start with the main presentation. After the presentation we have a drawing for prizes.\r\n\r\nAfter each meeting everyone is welcome to stay online and chat with others. We have a great time and usually have special guests appear during this time too.\r\n\r\nOur meetings are free! By meeting twice a month you have more access to amazing content, speakers, and opportunities than before. And, we do NOT have meetings of sales pitches! That\u0027s right. Every meeting is about sharing information to help you be a better professional. We never try to sell anything. \r\n\r\nEveryone is welcome. We are all on different paths, different journeys, with different interests. You are welcome to come and learn with us. \r\n\r\nBy joining this group you will receive announcements when new meetings are scheduled.
