    "abstract": "In today's rapidly evolving landscape of cloud computing and software architecture, the paradigms of serverless computing and API-driven architectures stand out as transformative forces driving efficiency, scalability, and innovation. This session explores these two intertwined concepts' core principles, benefits, and practical applications. Beginning with exploring serverless computing, we define its essence and trace its evolution from traditional server-based models. We unravel the manifold benefits it offers, from seamless scalability and cost-effectiveness to reduced operational overhead and accelerated time-to-market. Delving deeper, we dissect the critical components of serverless architecture, including Functions as a Service (FaaS), Backend as a Service (BaaS), and event-driven paradigms. Transitioning to API-driven architectures, we illuminate their pivotal role in modern software development, emphasizing their modularity, reusability, and interoperability. We discuss API design principles, the significance of API gateways, and real-world examples showcasing their transformative potential in diverse domains. Throughout the session, we navigate the intricate challenges and considerations, from cold start latency and vendor lock-in to security implications and monitoring complexities. Drawing from practical insights and future trends, we anticipate these paradigms' continued evolution and intersection with emerging technologies.",
